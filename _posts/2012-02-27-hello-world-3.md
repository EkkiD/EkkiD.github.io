Well, 8 months after it was first suggested to me that I should set up a domain and blog, here I am.  
  
I&#8217;m in the 4th(ish) year of my undergrad in Math and Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and I&#8217;m (at the time of this writing) in the middle of an internship with the Release Engineering team at [Mozilla][1]; . I&#8217;m a big supporter of free and open software and I&#8217;m excited to be a part of Mozilla.  
  
I&#8217;ve spent the last month or so automating the signing of Mozilla&#8217;s OS X builds. Keep and eye out for some upcoming blog posts detailing the process and some of the discoveries I&#8217;ve made about code signing tools on the Mac!
