I will be graduating at the end of August after 5(!) years pursuing a Bachelor&#8217;s of Mathematics in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.  
  
I spent the past 6 months or so searching (between classes, assignments, and exams) for full-time work beginning in September. By my calculation, I have participated in approximately 60 interviews (including phone, Skype and on-site) this year. I&#8217;ve been extremely lucky to meet many talented engineers and managers at a some very interesting companies. Naturally, I&#8217;m vary grateful to all of them for giving me the opportunity to interview for positions with their respective teams.  
  
I&#8217;ve ultimately decided to accept a position with [Upverter][1] . I am super excited to be joining this talented group. I love the idea of building a way to give other professionals similar sharing, collaboration, and version control tools to those that we programmers take for granted. I&#8217;m very happy to be joining the team at Upverter to do just that!  
  
I&#8217;m also looking forward to living in Toronto again (except for the looking-for-housing part). It&#8217;s a great city with a many great events going on.
